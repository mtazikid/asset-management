# How News Headlines Drives Stock Price Change

In this project we find the new headlines which drives a significant price change to the stock market.
We focus on 3 companies: “Tesla”, “Ford” and “General Motors”.
We get the historical stock price of these companies from https://finance.yahoo.com. In addition, we get the relevant news headline from New York Times search API.

The project consists of:
1. a jupyter notebook with a step by step data acquisition and analysis. 
2. data folder where the historical headline and stock price are stored.
3. model folder whrere the trained models (Random Forests) are stored.
